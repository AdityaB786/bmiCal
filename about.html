          Introduction to the body mass index (BMI)
        </h1>
        <p>
          Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used as an indicator of body fat
          content. Your weight alone is not sufficient to establish if you are
          in a healthy weight range. For example, a tall but slender person can
          weigh more than a short but plump individual. But the former may enjoy
          better health as long as their weight is suitable for their height.
          The ideal weight is also likely to differ for men and women of similar
          heights.
        </p>
        <p>
          How then do you know whether you fall in the healthy weight range or
          not? Your BMI solves this confusion. It correlates your weight with
          your height and evaluates whether your weight is appropriate for your
          stature. You can use a BMI calculator to find out your BMI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although not an exact measurement of body fat percentage, in most
          cases, BMI is a reliable tool for establishing risk levels for
          illnesses, especially ailments related to excess body fat. Many
          healthcare professionals use BMI to determine effective doses for
          medicines. Often people with a higher BMI need higher doses. Hence, it
          is crucial to be aware of your BMI to ensure your overall wellness.

        <h1 class="secondary-heading">How to calculate BMI</h1>
        <p>
          If you want to calculate your BMI, you have to find out your weight
          and height first. Once you know these values, you can arrive at the
          result by following the two steps mentioned below:
        </p>
        <div class="calculate-formula-box">
          ① Multiply your height by itself (height X height).
          <br />
          ② Divide your weight by the answer you get in the first step

            <p>
              For adults over the age of 20 years, BMI values are grouped into
              the following weight status categories:
            </p>
            <table class="table table-dark">
              <thead>

              <tbody>

                  <td>Below 18.5</td>
                  <td>UNDERWEIGHT</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>18.5–24.9</td>
                  <td>NORMAL WEIGHT</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>25–29.9</td>
                  <td>OVERWEIGHT</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>30–35</td>
                  <td>OBESE</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
              The range remains the same for males and females. There is no
              separate BMI calculator for men and women.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <h2 class="secondary-heading">BMI for Children</h2>
            <p>
              In children, body fat content changes with age. It is also normal
              for teenage girls to have more body fat than boys. BMI calculation
              for children follows the sameformula as adults. But the value is
              then plotted on standard gender-specific BMI-for-age percentile
              charts for children. It determines the child's weight status
              compared to children of the same gender and age.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>
                For example, a 25th percentile BMI for a 6-year old female child
                would indicate that the child's weight is higher than 25% of
                girls aged 6.</strong

          Excess weight brings with it countless health complications, some of
          which can be fatal. A higher BMI than average (over 25) is associated
          with increased risks for diseases like:

            <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
            <li>Heart conditions</li>
